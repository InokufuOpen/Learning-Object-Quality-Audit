# Learning Object Quality Audit

The objective of the Learning Object Quality Audit project (aka project LOQA) is to develop an opensource framework that can be used to universally evaluate the quality of any Learning Object.

The term __Learning Object__ is used here with the broadest meaning to encompass any educational resource, activity and their combination to learn a skill/competency.

If you want to contribute and/or help us build this framework, send us a message at contact@inokufu.com

# Overview :

## What's a LO (learning object) ?
The term __Learning Object__ is used here with the broadest meaning to encompass any educational resource, activity and their combination to learn a skill/competency.\

## How to asset EVERY LO ?

### 1/ It's all about change
When we talk about learning, we have to remember that it’s not so much about knowledge but about change.\ 
If anybody wants to learn something, in the end it’s because something has to change.\ 
If you want to learn a new job, it’s of course because you want to change job.\
If you want to learn management, it’s because you want to be a better manager.\
If you want to learn about sociology or neurology, it’s because you want to be a better person… or even perhaps shining more at some cocktail party.\
But there is always **a change** at the end of the road.\
So a good LO is a LO that enables that change.\
(Of course we know that Change = Willpower + Means + know-how. So learning is only a part of the problem)\
And of course, there are many types of change, so we need **a grid** for this. A clear ”Learning goal” grid.

### 2/ Some type of LO are very BAD but nevertheless we love them
Some LO are in theory very BAD, because they struggle to respect some basic pedagogical rule.\ 
For example, we know that is crucial to practice and to be active in learning. How a Youtube video do that ? It’s not impossible, but it’s very rare. Nevertheless videos make more LO than anything else and we know now a lot of people (us included) learn with them.\
So we have to assess them, at their level, without dreaming but with benevolency. And it’s possible with the help of “Learning Goals” and “Bloom’s taxonomy”.


## First com the LG (Learning Goal)
So every LO is a road to a potential change, to assess the road, we need to know where it goes.\
**It’s the rule number one** : For every LO, there is a LG and we can assess it only in relationship with the LG.\
There is a magical spell for this: 
**At this end of the LO the learn can [verbe] [description]**\
Exemple 1 : At the end of the video, the learner can explain the key element of the big bang theory.\
Exemple 2 : At the end of the MOOC, the learner can manage conflict in his workplace.

### Learning Goal Stairs : our take on bloom taxonomy
“Bloom’s taxonomy of Learning objective” (and all the various versions that exist in the field) are essential tools to have a good “Learning Goal”. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom%27s_taxonomy
Most of this taxonomy is for “traditional” training so we have our version :  **the “learning goal stairs” that are aimed to be useful for every LO type.\**

**1/ Discover :** 
Discovering is the first step. It’s to get an idea about the topic, to identify the key point, the issue, the pleasure and the difficulty of the field. At the end of the road, you are able to **talk about the field and follow the news about it.**_
A lot of “online LO” (Youtube, Wikipedia) do a very good job at this level.

**2 / Understand :** 
To understand a competency for real, not just on the surface, but in depth, **you are able to explain, interpret, estimate.** At the end of the road, the theory will hold no secrets for you.

**3/ Do** 
To practice, or simulate practice. This activity takes you into the concrete, knowing how to use, build and apply. At the end of the path, **you are operational**.
