**1** Academic Medicine is the official, peer-reviewed journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges. The journal serves as an international forum for the exchange of ideas, information, and strategies to address the major challenges facing the academic medicine community as it strives to carry out its missions in the public interest. The journalâ€™s areas of focus include: education and training issues; health and science policy; institutional policy, management, and values; research practice; and clinical practice in academic settings.

The article we choose, is speaking about the lack of common taxonomy for domains of competency for the health professions and physicians.
Faced with this observation, they propose a classification structure basing on several sources as the AAMC curriculum warehouse and MedEdPORTAL for example.

**5** The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is a medical research centers depending on the governement of the United States.

They create the NIH proficiency scale, that is an instrument used to measure one's ability to demonstrate a competency on the job. The scale captures a wide range of ability levels and organizes them into 5 steps; from ""Fondamental Awarness"" to ""Expert"".

**3** In this 2007 article published by Robin H. KAY and Liesel Knaack of the University of Ontario Institute of Technology, the authors point out that research in the area of learning assessment through OL is very incomplete. They also show that many researchers are not interested in the impact of OL on the learning situation itself and therefore offer few or no objective, quantitative and qualitative criteria for evaluating a learning object.

They nevertheless identify two main theoretical approaches in the way of evaluating a learning object: summative evaluation and formative evaluation.
The study explore a learning-based approach for evaluating learning object. It focuses on LO designed for secondary school students.

"Margaret Haughey of the University of Alberta and Bill Muirhead of the University of Ontario Institute of Technology offers a study on the assessment of learning objects in the context of teaching in the K-12 sector. They ""describe the developments in the K-12 sector, the arguments around LO characteristics and the development of an assessment profile"". The main goal of the analyses is to ""identifying characteristics of importance for the teachers"". 
They list 14 criteria divided into 5 categories : 
Integrity
Usability
Learning
Design
Values
